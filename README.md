🌍 WanderLust – Full Stack Booking Platform

WanderLust is a production-grade full stack web application that empowers users to discover, list, and manage vacation rentals with modern features like real-time geolocation, secure authentication, and cloud-hosted image storage.

The platform was designed with scalability, security, and user experience in mind — reflecting the same principles used in professional SaaS products. From seamless Google OAuth logins to dynamic property maps, WanderLust delivers an experience that mirrors real-world booking platforms.

✨ Highlights That Set This Project Apart

🔒 Enterprise-Level Authentication: Implemented multi-strategy Passport.js authentication (Google OAuth 2.0 + Local) with serialized sessions stored securely in MongoDB Atlas.

🗺️ Geospatial Intelligence: Integrated Google Maps API & geocoding to automatically plot property listings on maps with accurate coordinates.

☁️ Cloud-Native Architecture: Leveraged Cloudinary + Multer for scalable image hosting and optimized delivery (lazy-loading, caching).

🧩 Scalable MVC Design: Fully modular MVC architecture, ensuring maintainability and future feature expansion.

🗂️ Robust Data Integrity: Applied Joi schemas for request validation, eliminating malformed data before it reaches the database.

⚡ Performance & UX: Hosted on Render with MongoDB Atlas, delivering fast response times, reliable uptime, and smooth user flows.

📊 Real-World Security Practices: Used encrypted sessions, cookie management, flash messages for user feedback, and middleware-driven authorization.
